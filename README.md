# Lead_pipes_indiana
Lead Pipes and Poverty in Indiana

Summary of Project:

Inputs:
Mapping of lead pipes in Indiana from https://www.edf.org/health/mapping-lead-pipes-water-utility
Download excel file from the above link and convert 'EDF_Mapping_data' and 
'Indiana-LSL-Data-for-Interactive-Map_EDF' spread sheets into .csv files
The spreadsheets combine information from the EPA Safe Drinking Water Information
System (SDWIS) and and a voluntary state survey conducted in 2017. The survey
asked utilities about the location of service lines containg lead in their system.
As the survey was voluntary, only about 57.7% of utilities responded however the 
responses represented 92% of the service lines in the state.

This project also uses the census tiger line file for the county lines which can
be downloaded from the census website. The file is 'tl_2017_us_county.zip'

This project also uses data downloaded from the census API.

Outputs:

File structure/Order:
1 merge.py; outputs: lead_service_lines.csv (.csv file of the merged survey data)
2 analyze_indiana.py; inputs: lead_service_lines.csv; outputs: lsl.csv, lsl_layer.csv
3 census_data.py; inputs: none; outputs: 
4 trim_tl.py; inputs: 'tl_2017_us_county.zip'

Results:
The number of lead pipes in a county correlates with the level poverty in the county
and the relationship is likely not linear (take that into account if running a
regression)

Further analysis:

More granular data (challenge, utilities given as latitude and longitude make it
difficult to determine the extent )

ownership of pipes

confidence in record or estimate
